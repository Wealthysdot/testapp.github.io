.lenght is used to get the lenght of a string
.toLowerCase() is used to change string to lower 
.toUpperCase() is used to change string character to toUpperCase
lenght is a property so it does not have bracket but .toLowerCase is a method hence bracket
have you use the "return" command everything after it would not work
console.log is used to show or print it content 
you .leght the argument not the function 
[] is used to get the index of a text. 0 is the location of the first one 
language[0];
.at() is used to get the location from behind using minus
const language = "JavaScript";
language.at(-1); would display t
You can combine the .lenght and [] together
 language[ language.length - 2 ];

Say 
    function sum(a, b) {
    console.log(a);
    console.log(a + b);
    return a + b;
}
when you want to get a few character from a string you can use the 
SUBSTRING  method. e.g someString.substring(indexStart, indexEnd)
indexStart is the position of the first Characterr
indexEnd is the position of the first character you would like to ignore
const language = "JavaScript";
language.substring(1, 4); //"ava"

As we know + is used to add and concatenant
